# hello-world! 
Hey there!

My name is David Dias and I love sushi!
Ok, now a little more serious! (but for real, I love sushi).
Like I already said, I'm David, I'm 26 years old and I'm from Portugal. I consider myself an entrepreneur, travel junkie, data enthusiast and a dreamer! 
Besides that, my ultimate goal is to impact the world in some way.
